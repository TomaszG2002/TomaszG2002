This project demonstrates a Client-Server setup where both scripts run on a Raspberry Pi.

Client: Collects data, converts it into JSON format, and sends it to the server.
Server: Receives the JSON data, processes it, and displays it in a GUI using Tkinter.
The scripts communicate over the local network, showing how devices can share and display information effectively.
